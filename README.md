# Overview

This is a bot meant to streamline discussions of Baldur's Gate 3 on both Reddit and Discord. Heavily inspired by, but not affiliated with, [MTGCardFetcher](https://www.reddit.com/user/MTGCardFetcher/), it detects when users mention anything which has a top-level page on [bg3.wiki](https://bg3.wiki), and replies with embedded links to those pages.
